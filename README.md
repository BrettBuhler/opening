# Opening Master

Opening Master is a full-stack web application that lets users practice and perfect their chess openings. The application is built using React as the client-side JavaScript framework, Node as the JavaScript web server, Express as the Node.js web framework, and MongoDB as the document database.

Users are authenticated using Google OAuth and can save their chess openings to the database. After, users can practice their openings the Play mode or the Endless mode.

I built Opening Master from scratch between the dates of 11/06/2022 and 11/27/2022. My intention with the project was two-fold. 

First, I wanted to solve a real-world problem I had that did not have a readily available solution. I wanted to have software where I could practice my chess openings, and I wanted complete control over the moves I practiced. On sites like Chess.com, I could review specific openings, but I could not merge openings together and practice a larger repertoire.

Second, I wanted to test and develop my software engineering abilities. Before Opening Master, I had developed front end applications and backend applications, but I had not designed and built a full stack application from scratch. This project helped me understand the challenges faced in deploying web applications, library interdependencies, and how to utilize cloud products.

## Back End

Opening Master’s backend is hosted using Google’s App Engine. I wanted to get experience using cloud products, and Google offers in depth documentation on how to use their services. Thanks to this documentation, I was able to learn how to use their systems with no other external resources. While developing Opening Master, I learned how to use Google’s Administrator dashboard, and Google Cloud’s SDK shell, implement user authentication, and how to host a backend API.
