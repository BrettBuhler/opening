# Opening Master

Opening Master is a full-stack web application that lets users practice and perfect their chess openings. The application is built using React as the client-side JavaScript framework, Node as the JavaScript web server, Express as the Node.js web framework, and MongoDB as the document database.

Users are authenticated using Google OAuth and can save their chess openings to the database. After, users can practice their openings the Play mode or the Endless mode.

## Back End

Opening Master’s backend is hosted using Google’s App Engine. I wanted to get some experience in using cloud products, and Google offers in depth documentation on how to use their services. Thanks to this documentation, I was able to learn how to use their systems with no other external resources. While developing Opening Master, I learned how to use Google’s Administrator dashboard, and Google Cloud’s SDK shell, implement user authentication, and how to host a backend API.
