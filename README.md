# Opening Master

Opening Master is a full-stack web application that lets users practice and perfect their chess openings. I built this application using React as the client-side JavaScript framework, Node as the JavaScript web server, Express as the Node.js web framework, and MongoDB as the document database.

Users are authenticated using Google OAuth and can save their chess openings to the database. After, users can practice their chess openings in Play mode or the Endless mode.

The reason I developed Opening Master is as follows:

First, I wanted to solve a real-world problem that did not have a readily available solution. I wanted to have software where I could practice my chess openings, and I wanted complete control over the moves I practiced. On sites like Chess.com, I could review specific chess openings, but I could not merge chess openings together and practice a larger repertoire.

Second, I wanted to test and develop my software engineering abilities. Before Opening Master, I had developed front-end applications and back-end applications. However, I had not designed and built a full-stack application from scratch. This project helped me understand the challenges faced in deploying web applications, library interdependencies, and how to utilize cloud products.

## Back End

Opening Master’s back-end is hosted using Google’s App Engine. I wanted to get experience using cloud products, and Google offers in depth documentation on how to use their services. Thanks to this documentation, I was able to learn how to use their systems with no other external resources. While developing Opening Master, I learned how to use Google’s Administrator dashboard, Google Cloud’s SDK shell, implement user authentication, and how to host a back-end API through their App engine.
